# 📝 FDIC MCP Multi-Agent Integration: TODOs & Next Steps

## 🧠 Big Ideas & Next Steps

### 1. **Multi-Agent/Tool Infrastructure**

- [ ] Wire up FDIC MCP into a multi-agent platform (LangChain, CrewAI, or custom infra)
- [ ] Define agent roles:
  - Researcher (deep dives)
  - Sales (prospecting)
  - Analyst (trend detection)
  - Compliance (regulatory checks)
- [ ] Enable agents to chain requests, share results, and collaborate
- [ ] Use schemas to dynamically build valid queries for each endpoint
- [ ] Ensure robust logging and context passing between agents

### 2. **Ad Hoc Research & Analytics**

- [ ] Build dashboards or UIs for sales, marketing, and financial experts
- [ ] Enable bulk/interactive queries for insights (e.g., bank failures by state/year, deposit trends)
- [ ] Integrate with LLM-powered chatbots for natural language querying

### 3. **Operational Robustness**

- [ ] Implement paginated, rate-limited bulk queries for large datasets (e.g., 10,000+ records)
- [ ] Store results to disk/DB, not just RAM
- [ ] Monitor for rate limits and auto-retry with backoff
- [ ] Log progress and errors for resumability

### 4. **Agent Workflows & Collaboration**

- [ ] Codify agent workflows for:
  - Data mining
  - Visualization
  - Anomaly detection
  - Automated reporting
- [ ] Allow agents to pass context/results via MCP
- [ ] Add hooks for future agent types

### 5. **Dream Big**

- [ ] Explore interactive dashboards, automated reporting, anomaly detection, and more
- [ ] Consider LLM/AI-driven insights and recommendations
- [ ] Build for scale: support many agents, high concurrency, and massive datasets
