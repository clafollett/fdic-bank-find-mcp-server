        description: >-
          The primary internet web address is the public internet site
          obtained from the most recent FFIEC Call Report (CALL) for
          commercial banks or from the supplemental information for Thrift
          Financial Reporters (TFR). The primary internet web address is
          included only for those institutions reporting an address on the
          most recent FFIEC Call Report or Thrift Financial Report.  This
          information resides in the most recent demographic information file.
          For some institutions users will find that for the item Primary
          Internet Web Address: the caption will read 'Web site not
          available'.  Possible reasons that a Web site may not be available
          are: The institution failed to file on the most recent call report
          or TFR. The institution filed a primary Internet Web address on its
          most recent FFIEC Call Report; however, the address filed by the
          institution was not in accordance with the instructions provided by
          the FFIEC on how to file a primary Internet Web address or FDIC
          attempts to validate and access the site were unsuccessful. Users
          may also experience instances where the URL provided for primary
          Internet Web address in ID returns an error stating that the site is
          not found. Possible reasons for such occurrences are: The
          institution?s reported primary Web address was valid as of the date
          that the demographic information was updated in ID, but is no longer
          valid. The institution?s reported Internet Web address is valid, but
          the institution?s Web site was inoperable at the time that the user
          attempted to access it due to technical problems being experienced
          by the institution?s Web site, the institution?s web provider, the
          user?s Web provider, or other issues not related to the validity of
          the Web address.  Users are advised to contact the institution on
          any questions regarding the services provided by the institution.
          For questions involving the reporting of primary Internet Web
          address by those institutions that file a FFIEC Call report, users
          are advised to contact supervision@fdic.gov.  For questions
          involving the primary Internet Web address of institutions that file
          a Thrift Financial Report, users are advised to contact
          pamela.schaar@ots.treas.gov or call Ms. Schaar at (202) 906-7205.
