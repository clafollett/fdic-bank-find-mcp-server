For some institutions users will find that for the item Primary Internet Web Address: the caption will read 'Web site not available'.  Possible reasons that a Web site may not be available are: The institution failed to file on the most recent call report or TFR. The institution filed a primary Internet Web address on its most recent FFIEC Call Report; however, the address filed by the institution was not in accordance with the instructions provided by the FFIEC on how to file a primary Internet Web address or FDIC attempts to validate and access the site were unsuccessful. Users may also experience instances where the URL provided for primary Internet Web address in ID returns an error stating that the site is not found. Possible reasons for such occurrences are: The institution?s reported primary Web address was valid as of the date that the demographic information was updated in ID, but is no longer valid. The institution?s reported Internet Web address is valid, but the institution?s Web site was inoperable at the time that the user attempted to access it due to technical problems being experienced by the institution?s Web site, the institution?s web provider, the user?s Web provider, or other issues not related to the validity of the Web address.  Users are advised to contact the institution on any questions regarding the services provided by the institution.
